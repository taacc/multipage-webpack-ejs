			itemTitle: `19. ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER`,
			itemContent: `Any Dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms and Conditions may be resolved through binding arbitration in accordance with the Terms of this Arbitration Provision at either your or <em data-site="siteName">{{$SiteName}}</em>’ election, unless otherwise prohibited by law. The term "Dispute" means any dispute, claim or controversy regarding any aspect of your relationship with <em data-site="siteName">{{$SiteName}}</em> that has accrued or may hereafter accrue, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, tort (including without limitation claims arising from or pertaining to misrepresentation or negligence), and includes the validity and enforceability of this Arbitration Provision (with the exception of the enforceability of section (b) of the Restrictions clause provided below). Arbitration means that you will have a fair hearing before a neutral arbitrator instead of in a court by a judge or jury. Arbitration Procedures: If the parties are unable to resolve differences or disputes of any nature that may arise in relation to this Agreement after good faith negotiations, all such disputes shall be referred to arbitration by a single Arbitrator in accordance with the provisions of the Arbitration Law of Cyprus, Cap 4. The Arbitrator will be proposed by the Arbitration Service of the Cyprus Chamber of Commerce and Industry and must be approved by the parties. The place of the arbitration will be Nicosia, Cyprus, and the language of the proceeding shall be English. The arbitrator’s decision shall be final and binding but the arbitrator’s judgment may be entered in any court having jurisdiction and thereupon execution or other legal process may issue thereon. The costs of the arbitration shall be paid as determined by the arbitrator. If an award granted by the arbitrator exceeds $5,000, either party can appeal that award to a three-arbitrator panel administered by the same organization by a written notice of appeal filed within thirty (30) days from the date of entry of the arbitration award. The members of the three-arbitration panel will be selected according to the rules of the arbitration organization. The decision of the three-arbitrator panel shall be final and binding, except for any appellate right that exists under the Arbitration Law of Cyprus, Cap 4. In the event of a conflict between this Arbitration Provision and the rules of the arbitration organization chosen, this Arbitration Provision will govern. If the arbitration organization will not enforce this Arbitration Provision, it cannot serve as the arbitration organization to resolve your dispute. If the arbitration organization above is not available or permitted to arbitrate the Dispute for any reason, the parties shall agree on a substitute arbitration organization. If the parties are unable to agree, they shall mutually petition a court of appropriate jurisdiction to appoint a substitute arbitration organization that will enforce this Arbitration Provision as written. Restrictions: a.	Except for the case required by law, otherwise, you must contact us within one (1) year of the date of occurrence of the event or facts giving rise to a dispute or you waive the right to pursue any claim basing on such event, facts or dispute. b.	Individual names should be given to all parties to the arbitration must be named. There shall be no right or authority for any dispute to be arbitrated or litigated on a class action or consolidated basis or on bases involving disputes brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general publics, such as a private attorney general, or other similarly situated persons unless that statute under which you are suing provides otherwise. c.	All parties waive any claim to indirect, consequential, punitive, exemplary or multiplied damages arising from or out of any dispute with <em data-site="siteName">{{$SiteName}}</em> unless the statute under which they are suing provides otherwise. Severability: If any clause within this Arbitration Provision other than the class action waiver clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this Arbitration Provision, and the remainder of this Arbitration Provision will be given full force and effect. If the class action waiver clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable, the Arbitration Provision will be unenforceable, and the dispute will be decided by a court. Exclusions from Arbitration: You and <em data-site="siteName">{{$SiteName}}</em> agree that any claim filed by you or by <em data-site="siteName">{{$SiteName}}</em> that is not aggregated with the claim of any other persons and whose amount in controversy is properly within the jurisdiction of a court which is limited to adjudicating small claims shall not be subject to arbitration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, <em data-site="siteName">{{$SiteName}}</em> reserves the right to pursue the protection of intellectual property rights and confidential information through injunctive or other equitable relief through the courts. Continuation: This Arbitration Provision will survive the termination of your Service with Cutefate. Class and Consolidated Claims Waiver. It is agreed that neither party shall have the right to participate as a class representative or class member with respect to any Disputes subject to arbitration under this Agreement or any Dispute between the parties. The parties also waive any right to assert consolidated claims with respect to any Disputes subject to arbitration under this Agreement or any Dispute between the parties. Limit of Liability Liability for both parties is limited $3,000 in damages. Parties waive and the Arbitrator shall not be empowered to grant indirect, consequential, special, punitive or exemplary damages and/or damages or relief in excess of those permitted by this Agreement unless the statute under which they are suing provides otherwise. An arbitration award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction for the purposes of enforcement. `
